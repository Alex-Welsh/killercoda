### Welcome to StackHPC's Python Killercoda challenge

This exercise will cover some Linux command line basics and a short Python
programming task.

The programming task is purposefully open ended, and you are encouraged to make
any design descisions you think will improve the program.

Try to answer the questions using only the tools available in the terminal
where possible, but feel free to ask for help or use the internet if you need
some pointers.
