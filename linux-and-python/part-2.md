### Part 2 - Python Programming

You have been given a partially written Python program in the
`rock-paper-scissors.py` file. The program is designed to play a game of rock,
paper, scissors with a user. 

The program should:
- Ask the user for their choice of rock, paper, or scissors
- Generate a random choice for the computer
- Compare the choices and declare a winner

You can run the program with the command `python rock-paper-scissors.py`{{exec}}. 

The program is incomplete and there are a few ways you could improve it. 

## Your task

1. Complete the program so that it plays a game of rock, paper, scissors with the user.
2. Make any changes or improvements you think would make the program better. 

You can use any Python libraries you think are necessary. 

When you run the program, it should look something like this:

```
Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors!
Please enter your choice: rock
The computer chose: scissors
You win!
```

Good luck!

### Extension ideas

You are welcome to extend your program in any way you see fit. If you're not
sure what to do, here are a few ideas to get you started:

- How could you make the program more interactive or user-friendly?
- What error handling could you add to the program?
- How could you expand the game to include additional choices or features?
